### Running this repository

This repository can be started like any standard Rails application by running `./bin/setup` and then `./bin/dev` Once it is running, in a 2nd terminal is it possible to run `rails refresh:touch_all` which will cause the `/groups/1/users` page to continually refresh every 5 seconds in order to demo the behavior I am encountering.
